# OpenAI - Assistant
The Assistants API allows you to build AI assistants within your own applications. An Assistant has instructions and can leverage models, tools, and knowledge to respond to user queries. The Assistants API is designed to help developers build powerful AI assistants capable of performing a variety of tasks.
You can learn more about the OpenAI Assistant API [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview).

## Note
This Entrire Script has been taken reference from the Official Documentation from [OpenAI Assistant](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction).

## How it Works

This program includes basic and key steps to create and run an Assistant that uses Code Interpreter. Here, we're creating an Assistant, with the Code Interpreter tool enabled.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhawansolanki/OpenAI-Assistant.git
cd OpenAI-Assistant
```

2. Create an Environment:

```bash
python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```

3. Activate Environment

For Mac:

```bash
source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate
```

For Windows:

```bash
python -m venv c:\path\to\myenv
```

4. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setting up Environment Variables
Before running the script, you must set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. This can be done in the command line or by setting it in a .env file.

Command line method:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
```

### Usage

Run the script with the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can customize the script or build upon the code to create a more interactive experience.
